# Baruch's IMG - Risk and Portfolio Management
The Investment Management Group began at Baruch College in the summer of 2010 as a simulated fund. As of November 2017, IMG is managing a real-money fund of over $340,000 in AUM. We use a combination of fundamental and technical analyses to evaluate investment ideas. Through our process, we perform both top-down and bottom-up analysis to narrow down macro-econimc and micro-economic factors. We then employ our research to isolate idiosyncratic opportunities in all sectors.

To better manage our risk and guide our portfolio managment process, we have devised tools to better analyze our positions and create more sustainable investing
